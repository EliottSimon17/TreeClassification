# TreeClassification
Classifying data using a decision tree model with sckit-learn. \\
This project compares two data set. \\
Checks the accuracy considering both the entire and the max_depth = 1 tree. \\
By incrementing the min_sample_leaf we can observe the areas of overfitting, underfitting in both datasets.
