# TreeClassification
Classifying data using a decision tree model with sckit-learn. <br>
This project compares two data set (Breast Cancer in Wisconsin and Diabetes). <br>
Checks the accuracy considering both the entire and the max_depth = 1 tree. <br>
By incrementing the min_sample_leaf we can observe the areas of overfitting, underfitting in both datasets.
